I am a PhD student in Computer Science at Stevens Institute of Technology, advised by [Dr. Tian Han](https://hthth0801.github.io/).

My research interest lies in ***Generative Probabilistic Model***, such as ***Energy-based Model***, ***Generator Model***, ***Diffusion Probabilistic Model***. My works focus on developing the generative probabilistic framework for **modelling data distribution** and ***learning (hierarchical) interpretable representations***. 


Please don't hesitate to contact me for collaborationðŸ˜Š.
