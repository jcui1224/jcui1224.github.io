I am a PhD student (2021 Fall - now) at Stevens Institute of Technology, advised by [Prof. Tian Han](https://hthth0801.github.io/).

My research goal is to develop models that can *understand the world in an efficient and effective way*,
> *What I cannot create, I do not understand.*
>
> -- <cite>Richard Feynman</cite>

such that my main works focus on **probabilistic generative modeling** and learning **interpretable (hierarchical) data representations** in computer vision. 

Please don't hesitate to contact me for collaboration😊.
